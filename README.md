# conlang-text-gen
Modified version of Mark Rosenfelder's (zompist.com) gen - language text generator.

Changed the look and feel of Mark Rosenfelder's awesome language text generator on [zompist.com](http://www.zompist.com/gen.html) to look better and work on mobiles. I really love his generator, but I feel the user interface is really dated, and does not hold up to modern web standards.

The most up-to-date version can be found on my github.io page (direct link [here](https://bodzaital.github.io/conlang/)). Older versions are listed below, and kept for (mainly my own) legacy reasons.

## Changelog
 - v2017.2: See full changelog [at the releases tab](https://github.com/bodzaital/conlang-text-gen/releases/tag/v2017.2).
 - v2017.1: Changed look and feel. The app uses bootstrap, and has a responsive layout that works on mobiles and desktops. No extra functionality added. This release aimed to port every part of the original to a more modern interface.
 
## Roadmap
I plan on adding additional features to the app, like a better "how to" dialog, different functions for buttons, and contextual help messages.

 - **Added in v2017.2:** Different (hopefully better) "how to" dialog.
 - ~~Contextual help messages.~~
 - **Added in v2017.2:** More colors.
 - **Added in v2017.2:** ~~Brief description on the page~~ instead, in the help window.
 - Better position for the output on smaller screens.
 - **Added in v2017.3:** Save/Load functionality (~~either~~ through ~~a dialog or~~ localStorage).
