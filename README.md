# conlang-text-gen
Modified version of Mark Rosenfelder's (zompist.com) gen - language text generator.

Changed the look and feel of Mark Rosenfelder's awesome language text generator on [zompist.com](http://www.zompist.com/gen.html) to look better and work on mobiles. I really love his generator, but I feel the user interface is really dated, and does not hold up to modern web standards.

## Changelog
 - v2017.1: Changed look and feel. The app uses bootstrap, and has a responsive layout that works on mobiles and desktops. No extra functionality added. This release aimed to port every part of the original to a more modern interface.
 
## Roadmap
I plan on adding additional features to the app, like a better "how to" dialog, different functions for buttons, and contextual help messages.

 - Different (hopefully better) "how to" dialog.
 - Contextual help messages.
 - More colors.
 - Brief description on the page.
 - Better position for the output on smaller screens.
